During the covid-19 situation where all workplaces and schools were closed,
the use of mobile phones and watching YouTube videos for learning have
been increased among students. Children usually require a common platform in which all of their needs can be satisfied. There is a need to develop
such an application for them. My idea is to develop an android application
for children by providing them with the videos on their interested areas
available from YouTube discarding unnecessary videos that may distract
them.
Viewers can switch from typical kids programming to some of the unusual videos Bridle mentioned with a simple click. Due to YouTube’s auto
play feature, it doesn’t always take any user activity to reach these clips.
Rather than removing YouTube from children’s access, it is critical to promote their supervised and filtered use of the platform. There are apps like
YouTube kids which usually has cartoons and related videos which can be
useful for only primary level kids. There are no videos on such apps that
can meet all the interests of a child. So i developed one to meet their needs.
